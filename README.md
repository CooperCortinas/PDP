Personal Data Project

Motivation: I wanted to find out how the amount I run correlates to how much I eat and how much sleep I get, and I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the sleep and eating as well.

Data Process:  I collected the sleep data and the running data through a Garmin Forerunner 235 watch and the Garmin Connect app.  I collected calories eaten through the MyFitnessPal app which connects to the Garmin Connect app.  I would make sure to track everything I ate throughout the day and to track every run I went on as well as making sure to wear the watch to sleep every night to make this data as accurate as possible.  I was thinking about removing the days that I do not run but decided that it would be good to have the days that I have no running to act as a baseline or just a normal day of eating and sleeping.  I did remove the month of September because I was sick during the whole month and being sick would have had no running with lots of sleep and not as much eating, so the data would have been skewed.










Motivation: You should describe the question you set out to answer at the start of the project or
what led you to the specific dataset that you selected.
•Data Process: The centerpiece of your writeup should be a comprehensive discussion of your
process for sourcing, collecting, cleaning, and transforming the raw data into your final dataset. The
instructions should be clear enough that someone else could reproduce your process based on just the
ReadMe file to obtain the same final results. Note that this doesn’t necessarily have to be more than
a couple of sentences but it should be complete.
•Visualization: The ReadMe should contain at least one visualization summarizing the data. The
visualizations should follow the principles of good figure design and be sufficiently documented to
explain what they are demonstrating.
•Analysis: Finally, the ReadMe should describe the results of at least one method from this course
that you applied to the dataset and what you learned from it. This can be anything from a simple EDA
technique like identifying outliers, making a box plot of a column, evaluating the summary statistics
(Tukey’s 5 numbers), to one of the regression models from supervised learning, or one of the clustering
methods from unsupervised learning. This is not an exhaustive list of possibilities and as with the
previous components doesn’t need to be long or drawn out.
